I know it‚Äôs summer, but there‚Äôs still a lot going on, so I‚Äôm going to try to jump on every few weeks or so and just compile a list of stuff I think you should know about what‚Äôs happening here on A2C or in admissions in general.

**A2C BANNER COMPETITION VOTING:** Don‚Äôt forget to vote for our 400k celebration A2C Banner! Voting closes this **Sunday, July 18th at 11:59 PM EDT.** Find more info and the banner voting form [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ojms7b/a2c_banner_competition_voting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**ONE HOUR AMA SERIES:** Periodically, we get requests for AMAs or we invite people who are well-versed in college admissions, to do One Hour AMAs with us. We are excited to announce two in the next couple of weeks! Please mark your calendars for these if you‚Äôd like to take part. 

* **THIS MONDAY, JULY 19, from 8 PM - 9 PM CST**, we‚Äôll have an **AMA-AE** (AMA About Essays) with the **College Essay Guy, Ethan Sawyer**. He‚Äôs done a couple of AMAs with us over the last few years and given amazing advice about the personal essay and the supplements. If you don‚Äôt know about College Essay Guy yet, you can learn more about Ethan at [www.collegeessayguy.com](http://www.collegeessayguy.com/), but here‚Äôs some of his bio: ‚ÄúEthan Sawyer is a nationally recognized college essay expert and sought-after speaker. Each year he helps thousands of students and counselors through his online courses, workshops, articles, products, and books, and works privately with a small number of students. Raised in Spain, Ecuador, and Colombia, Ethan has studied at seventeen different schools and has worked as a teacher, curriculum writer, voice actor, motivational speaker, community organizer, and truck driver. A graduate of Northwestern University, Ethan holds an MFA from UC Irvine and two counseling certificates.‚Äù Again, his AMA-AE will just be for one hour, so be prepared with your questions, and of course, as always be patient and polite. He might not have time to get to everyone‚Äôs questions, but the community can jump on and answer your questions, and you can learn a lot from reading his responses to others.
* **On TUESDAY, JULY 27 from 5 PM - 6 PM CST, The University of Pennsylvania Admissions** team will be doing an AMA. We are honored that they are taking the time to join us! Be prepared with questions and be ready to learn! (Of course,  I know it goes without saying, but be patient and polite -- and aware that they might not get to your questions within the hour, but we will link the AMA and you can learn from others).

**ONE EASY HINT FOR PERSONAL ESSAYS:** One great way to check and see if your essay is personal enough is to try to incorporate these words into your essay. If they don‚Äôt fit in the content and context, that might be a clue your essay isn‚Äôt personal enough: I think, I believe, I wonder, I feel, to me

**ADMISSIONS BLOG PROFILE:** I love Georgia Tech‚Äôs Blog, and in the most recent post, Rick Clark, Dean of Admissions talks about the importance of understanding the mission of a college and making sure that mission matches your mission -- and you match their mission. This should be an essential part of your research when you‚Äôre making your college list.  Be sure to check it out[ here](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/).

**COLLEGES THAT CHANGE LIVES COLLEGE FAIRS:** Even if you don't think you want to attend a liberal arts college, I encourage you to go to one of their college fairs. It can help you to figure out what you do and don't want as you chat with the admissions officers and learn more about their offerings. And I encourage you not to make the same mistake we see year after year of not considering potential merit aid you might need and the possibility that that long list of highly highly selective colleges you're applying to just might not work out. Also, be sure to chat with them about meaningful research for all you pre-med students out there (and others!). [Find a CTCL fair near you here.](https://ctcl.org/info-sessions/)

**JUNIOR/SENIOR TIMELINE:** Here‚Äôs a[ link to my Admissions Journey Timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nxi29t/hey_rising_juniors_and_seniors_this_admissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I know many of you are still looking for basic advice about what to do when, so be sure to read through this. Don‚Äôt allow yourself to get overwhelmed by it; it‚Äôs just a guide to let you know what you might need to be doing.

**A HELPFUL HINT:** Make an admissions-only email account. I suggest firstname.lastname.college@whateveremailyoulikebest. You will get overwhelmed by piles of info from colleges and you will need to be able to easily access it. And it‚Äôs helpful if that info is coming from colleges you‚Äôre actually interested in rather than the ones College Board or ACT sold your name to. Use that email address for your applications. This summer, one thing for sure you can do is ‚Äúrequest info‚Äù from all the schools you‚Äôre interested in with your admissions-only email address -- that way they can start counting your interest (if they consider it) and you can start gathering the info you need about the colleges you care about. 

**SHARE YOUR ADVICE:** Do you have some advice or a helpful hint you‚Äôd like to share here for others to learn from? Please do!

**ASK QUESTIONS:** While Google (and our search bar) should be your friend, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out and ask questions. You can ask here and I‚Äôll try to answer (and maybe some others will too!) or ask on the subreddit, but also be sure you ask your high school counselor (when you get back to school) and the colleges themselves!

**KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING:** Keep supporting each other, advising each other, and sharing your thoughts, worries, concerns, excitement, words of encouragement, and advice! Don't forget to take time to breathe and recharge your batteries every once in a while :) -- ‚òÄÔ∏èüòéIt is summer after all!

Take care,

Now I don't mind taking another SAT, but the thing is I'm like literally so poor lmao. I read that SAT is valid for 5 years, and I planned to apply next year, so my SAT will be 3 years old.

Technically I can still use it. But I'm wondering would it worth any less, let's say if it against the same score but taken more recently

What do you guys think?




P.S I was actually already gave up on my dream, it took me two years to accept the fact that I'm just too poor to reach it. And I know I'm smart (not to be cocky), but I'm not THAT smart to get a full ride to Ivies, so shut up mom.

I was actually contend, now that at least I accept where my place is (not to sound cringe). But when I stumbled upon the news, I was excited at first, but now I'm afraid that I will end up disappointed again and fall harder than before :(

I am at that point in high school where I *really* need to have my college list ready, I‚Äôm set on a neuroscience major as premed, perhaps with a double major in computer science, but that depends. 

I‚Äôm so tired of seeing and hearing people ‚ÄúHarvard this, Georgetown that‚Äù, my parents believe I‚Äôm so kind of genius that can get into a place like Yale with just insanely good grades (try bursting their bubble, you can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried). As an international I‚Äôm pretty certain I won‚Äôt be able to get into those even though I‚Äôm working my ass off to get into a good school, and as an international premed? Yeah, no way. Although I am doing research every day for the past few months, I was just wondering if you guys had any ideas or know of good schools that are not elite or super hard to get into (like more than a 7% acceptance rate) and maybe offer financial aid (that doesn‚Äôt need to be a must).

Maybe it‚Äôs a long shot, but I thought I‚Äôd maybe find some helpful advice here, too.

I‚Äôm not looking for an elite school, I‚Äôm looking for a great school *for me*. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read, y‚Äôall are angels!

13,Unpopular Opinion: Applying to a summer school program might help internationals in different ways,21,ondmih,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ondmih/unpopular_opinion_applying_to_a_summer_school/,10,1626728605.0,"Hear me out.

Most of us come from academically rigorous backgrounds that often entail rote learning and a lot of BS. 

Having prior exposure to a similar version of the US application process through the summer school apps might help us a lot imo.

I've personally felt a greater understanding of the application process post completing summer schools apps even though I got waitlisted, then rejected cmao (C stands for crying).

Coming from someone who's studied in an education system that once made me memorise the number of people in an imaginary village for the purposes of examination I think
an exposure to these essays in my summer apps, helped me start thinking early on about the things that matter & definitely helped in the US application process.

That being said, this is just something to consider..
I definitely agree that most of the programs are a cashgrab, but I feel there must be at least one ""good fit"" for those international students out there.
 It's possible (even though unlikely) that they might even provide aid.

Maybe this one summer school application might help you down the long haul.


Peace Out :)

Edit: By a good fit, I meant consider it's affordability as well.
In case you're not in a position to pay, apply for aid at the ones that do provide aid to internationals."

ive been trying to write my resume/activities list for the past couple hours and my head feels like exploding right now. i was always strong academically (all As) until last year, my junior year, when my dad was sick in the hospital, so i started struggling with my grades in school. i got 3 b's for first semester, which probably isnt even that bad but i started freaking out (ik im annoying). so to make up i took on a bunch of ECs and now everything in my life just feels all over the place.

i feel like all my activities are scattered and i wasted all my time for doing nothing. i struggled so hard during second semester to keep up with grades and all my activities. even when summer started, i had no time to do anything because of my job, internship, 2 cc classes, college essays, and all my clubs/organizations that are continuing. and now that i failed the act yesterday, i feel like i was focusing my energy on the wrong things. sorry this probably makes no sense but i feel so lost right now. im looking at all my activities and i dont even know if they fit under the major i want to be in. hope i get into college

Write a handful of target/safety school EA essays until you are familiar with the feeling and then write your ED/REA/SCEA essays.

I started UNC and UC System essays over the summer. When I re-read them after school started, I found they were basically trash and re-wrote. Then I wrote Georgia Tech essays, which look decent even when I re-read them months later. Finally, I started Stanford essays in mid-October (if you can, start earlier than I did) and they are so amazing and cure my imposter syndrome every time up to today. I felt that was my peak performance, and the essays after that felt not that good cuz I was less mentally invested and got tired over the process.

In conclusion, I advise you to

a) Write some essays for other schools, and then write dream school essays

b) Write dream school essays, don't submit, write some essays for other schools, and come back to dream school essays to edit or write new drafts. (Don't delete the old essays that may look like trash tho)"

**Get some well-deserved rest**

Yes, that‚Äôs right! Stop thinking about your performance, school, or college admissions for a moment. Instead, take a deep breath, give yourself a couple of days off, and spend them with family and friends. Go on a beach; it‚Äôs summer after all.¬†

**Review your performance and think if you need to get additional score reports**

Make time for self-reflection and analyze what you did great and where you had trouble on the ACT. If you decided to apply to a school after taking this test, think if there are more colleges you want to apply to than those four you‚Äôve already requested to send your scores. If so, go ahead and google them; you can also find plenty of helpful information regarding admissions and college life on schools‚Äô websites.¬†

**Think of a retake**

Your results should come out great! But if it is your first attempt at taking the ACT, you probably will want to have at least one more try to see if you can score higher after more practice. Plus, having multiple score reports will allow you to pick the best ones for each separate section and send your superscore to schools accepting it.

Anyway, it‚Äôs time to relax, for now. You did a great job, and it is what you really deserve!"

I'm not regretting the decision at all, but how exactly am I supposed to apply to colleges for a second time? Will my common app account clear and reset on August 1st? Is it worth it to apply to a couple of the same schools that I didn't get into last year but got deferred/waitlisted from? And how do I get counselor recommendations?
Anyways thanks for the help I'm just pretty confused right now."

28,Don't wait until the last minute to do your applications! But if you do...,132,omxyfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/omxyfz/dont_wait_until_the_last_minute_to_do_your/,19,1626666782.0,"Edited with more tips

**TL;DR:** Do your apps as early as possible. If you know you're a procrastinator, and are going to write all your apps at the last minute, I've been in your shoes and I can help. If you're starting early and are super on top of your apps, this information should also be helpful for you.

I bet you're thinking to yourself ""I'm going to start all my applications early and they'll all be done at least a week before my first ED/EA apps is due"". That's what I thought too- two years in a row. Both years I did my applications very last minute. The first year was a disaster. The second year, I wrote the application that got me into a school with a <10% acceptance rate in 2 days. I want to share what I learned with you all. I'll probably repost this in December.

All these points also work for those of you who are starting early. But for those of you who will be in desperate straits in the week or two before your apps are due, these steps are critical.

*DISCLAIMER: I am just a kid who got lucky and spent a ton of time on college apps. I did my application process almost entirely by myself (with the help of my mom to check grammar and my best friends to talk through concepts with), so I have no clue what exactly helped me get into my school. If you are paying for an admissions counsellor or are working with an admissions professional PLEASE LISTEN TO THEM AND DON'T TRUST ME!*

1. **Start early, even if you start late**

Begin thinking about apps in advance, even if you wind up not finishing them until the last minute. Since you're on A2C, you're already off to a good start.

Create your college list ASAP- I used the Princeton review book to bookmark possible options and then narrow down the list based on my criteria, making sure to include safeties and matches. When I had gotten the list down to roughly 2x the number of schools I was planning to apply to (I would do 1.5x if you're applying to 20+ schools) I started doing virtual visits, info sessions, reaching out to current students, doing independent research on the school, etc.

If your school offers interviews before applying, sign up for them ASAP, as they go fast at prestigious schools. A great way to show interest and get your questions answered more honestly than an AO will respond.

To simplify this process, I created a spreadsheet of the schools I was interested in with columns for the factors I cared about (i.e. quality of life rating average amount of debt for a graduating student, racial and socioeconomic diversity) and a column for notes as I went along. I used the function that lets you color code columns based on how close they are to the mean- red for the schools on my list with a higher than average debt per student and green for lower than average on my list, for example- which made it easy to see which schools ranked well across categories I cared about.

**2.** **Don't begin with your dream school (unless you have to)**

There are plenty of other posts saying this exact same thing, but your first college essays will, in all likelihood, be trash, especially if you're pumping them out last minute like I did. Start with safeties if at all possible, although if you're putting things off like I did, this might not work if you're applying to your dream school ED. If that's the case, try to apply to some safeties EA so you're forced to do them for the deadline at the same time as your ED school.

**3. Complete simple tasks to build momentum**

The hardest part is getting started. Everyone says this, but it's true. Create a common app account and fill out the basic information. Copy paste your schools' prompts into separate word docs and put some random bullet points of brain stormed ideas below them. Invite your recommenders. Do short outlines. Sign up for events. Type up and process your notes.

**4. Block out time to work and stick to it- but also block out time for yourself**

Set a timer for you to work uninterrupted. Turn your phone on do not disturb and have the only things open on your computer be college related tabs. Be in a quiet place if possible. This timer can be 15 minutes, or something more like word count (I let myself take a break after every 100 words I wrote, just so that I had motivation to do something). Trying to pump all your essays out in one sitting with no breaks is possible, but it's more than likely that you'll get burnt out, especially if the reason you've been putting off apps is because you're overwhelmed.

Taking even just 30 minutes for yourself to do something you enjoy can be critical to success. I would take nice long showers and text a friend for 20 minutes each day as my breaks, because I put off work so long my entire life was essentially apps. Those breaks left me with a clear mind and helped me get new ideas. Get enough sleep if you do nothing else. Your might get more work done if you sleep 3 hours a night, but I am almost certain the quality of your work will be so bad you'll have to re-write most of it.

**5.** **Create a clear and consistent strategy**

I'm not just talking about scheduling time for apps. Have a process and repeat it for every app if possible. This was mine. Look up if school tracks demonstrated interest. If so, sign up for as many events as possible and follow them on social media. If not, choose one or two events you're interested in and think will be helpful.

Create a doc with the school's prompts and your research on it. Research in a consistent way so you don't fall down the rabbit hole of just doing research to avoid writing.

I broke my research into three sections: academics, student life, and culture. Pull up the list of all the clubs at the school and write down the 4-5 you find most interesting and you think show something about your, whether it's that you're willing to try new things or that you have a very specific interest. Google the club and check it's social media/website. A lot of the clubs on these lists are no longer operating, and it's a big yikes to write about how much you want to join a club that doesn't exist. Find a study abroad program you're interested in. Ideally on unique to your school (so not SIT) but if it has to be another one, that's okay too.

Look at the list of majors. Go to the departments your interested in and look at the major requirements. If you're genuinely interested in multiple majors (and especially if you're applying to a LAC/school that doesn't make you declare immediately, check to see how many majors there are in a major/how many resources that major seems to have. Ideally, don't put the most popular major as your first choice, and don't put a super unpopular one that the school will probably be closing to save money in a few years. Look through the courses offered for that major and pick out a few you're interested in, putting them and their course description in your doc. Mention classes in different departments if you're applying to a school that values interdisciplinary interests. Choose 2-3 classes if you're only mentioning one major and one for each interest if you're doing interdisciplinary. Many departments have resources like specialized libraries, symposiums, peer mentoring groups, unique study abroad/internship opportunities, and research. Find the ones that interest you.

Culture is the most generic, but basically the vibe of the school that drew you to it. Find a few examples of this culture in action, ideally not from the front page of the school's website.

After compiling all this research, process it. Cut out redundant examples and group your research by theme rather than category (i.e. if there's an academic program in an area of interest and a student life club in that interest, they go together). You can also group them by characteristics of yourself you want to show: curiosity, studiousness, altruism, etc. I like to get to this stage before an interview and draw on the info I've learned.

Don't mention all of the processed research in your essays, word count is limited and you don't want to just list things the school has. Once you have your research processed, split it up into the different prompts. The why us prompts require the most use of this research, obviously, but for other prompts, knowing the vibe of the school intimately will help you understand what themes you should put in your essays. If a school has multiple why us essays, don't repeat specific examples across them, although you can bring up similar vibes as long as you describe them in different ways.

Create an outline and then go to town writing. Standardize your editing/revision process as well, so there are specific things you focus on on the first/second/third/fourth/fifth pass every time.

**6. Carefully tailor your apps to each school- reusing essays doesn't work (most of the time)**

Look, I know when it's the last minute, reusing apps is tempting, but schools aren't lying when they say they can tell. NEVER reuse a why us essay, even if you're swapping out the details for each school. I guess if two schools have nearly identical prompts you can reuse an essay, but even then I would alter them a little to fit with the rest of your app (I can see reusing making sense for an EC essay or an overcoming struggle prompt, but be careful you are fully answering the unique prompt of each school, even if the gist of the prompts are the same across the schools).

As far as what to do, when I say tailor I do mean be as specific as possible. Do your research, go to events, talk to alums and current students. But you can go much deeper than that if you feel like it. Find your AO. Send them an email if you have a legit question, but don't just email them random shit so they know you exist. They're overwhelmed and don't need that. But do google your AO. Their LinkedIn page can be helpful so you can see what they majored in. If they were a classical English major, you can probably make that weird reference to an obscure 1700s English work. If they majored in physics, probably not. That doesn't mean you should write about physics when your passion is English, please god don't, but it does mean you should know your audience.

My AO had a portfolio of PowerPoints showing his ability to do graphic design, and one of them was a presentation he showed to students at schools he visited about what he liked to see in applications- which was a huge score. At big schools especially, you may be able to find a video of your AO giving an admissions presentation or an article they wrote about admissions. You can use this information to tweak your app a little. For example, on my AOs PowerPoint he said that he liked when applicants showed their personalities in the description's of their ECS, so I made a separate EC description for this one app that included some jokes and sarcasm that matched the rest of my app. I didn't go overboard though, still kept the bones of my original EC descriptions.

**7. Give yourself room to fail**

Part of the reason I put off my apps for so long was that I knew they had to be the best essays I ever wrote if I wanted to get into my favorite schools. I felt like none of my ideas were good enough and that left me inert. WRITE BAD FIRST DRAFTS! Get something on paper. You can completely scrap it later. It can be the worst thing you've ever written. It can be 5x the word limit. If it's so bad it's unsalvageable, well now you know what you don't want your writing to sound like.

**8. That being said, revise and edit ruthlessly and with a plan**

Take your terrible first draft and shine it. Don't be afraid to tear down what you've written or to totally reshape your work. Have 1-2 people read your essays and give you recommendations, but also push back when they don't feel like the right choice. You can use what you don't like in their revision ideas/criticism to see what really matters to you in your essay.

You can do your apps by yourself, but if you're not an expert at cutting words, enlisting someone to help slash your excessively long supplement is super helpful. They can see area to cut that you miss because you've read it so many times.

Look for words you fall back on. Almost all of us repeat certain words quite frequently. I had a friend who's 3rd draft of a 200 word essay said ""palpable"" 8 times and it made me want to pull my hair out. Control f for words you feel like you use too frequently. A thesaurus is your friend. AOs say they don't want you using a thesaurus to sound super sophisticated, and you definitely shouldn't do that, but using a thesaurus to find a common/semi-common word to replace a word you're reusing is helpful.

The best editing tip I've ever heard is to read your essay backwards- read the final sentence first, then the one before it, etc- When you've been staring at an essay for hours it's easy to miss stupid mistakes, so disconnecting the sentences from the story is an easy way to catch grammatical errors, missing words, misspellings, or repeated words.

**9. Done is beautiful**

There is no reason to turn in your apps late (okay yes there are reasons to turn in your apps late- but only if they are actually incomplete at the deadline or if you're going to be 1-2 minutes late submitting). No matter how bad your app is, you have an exponentially better chance getting in with a completed app than with no app at all. Be relieved that you have something to submit and don't beat yourself up because it's not perfect. Know your deadline and don't break it, even if you go right up to it. I live on the west coast, and I submitted my first app my first year at 10 my time. The common app marked it as late. I know the school saw the submission time and knew it wasn't actually late, but after that I always submitted before 12 EST."

43,Why you shouldn‚Äôt make UT Austin your dream school (from an incoming freshman),88,omwkaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/omwkaj/why_you_shouldnt_make_ut_austin_your_dream_school/,24,1626662538.0,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôve been meaning to make this post for a while but I figured I‚Äôd wait until the class of ‚Äò26 started populating the subreddit. This post may contradict things you‚Äôve heard in the past or repeat information you already know. Either way, I hope it helps. 

UT Austin has the most inconsistent admissions of any school I know of. Here‚Äôs my story: I applied for chemical engineering under priority application and I also applied to the CNS honors program known as polymathic scholars. I know, it seems unusual to apply to a major in one school then honors in another but I knew it had been done before. Anyway, I got capped, also known as ‚Äúaccepted to the coordinated admissions program‚Äù (essentially an instate rejection). Since I was rejected from the school, they didn‚Äôt even look at my honors application. Soon after getting rejected, I sent in an appeal to see if I could get my admissions decision overturned. I knew it was a long shot, but who cares. Anyway, it worked and I was accepted for chemical engineering. A few weeks later, I got an email from the CNS honors director saying I had been admitted to the Polymathic Scholars. To rephrase that: the same school that rejected me for general admission accepted me into a far more competitive honors program. Same school, same admissions staff.

What‚Äôs crazier is that my story isn‚Äôt even that much of an outlier. We‚Äôve all heard of kids getting rejected from UT and getting into ivy league schools and schools of equal merit. The worst offender being CS. I know dozens of kids who fit that description from my highly competitive instate high school alone. 

Also, for you instate auto admit kids, don‚Äôt get too comfortable. I personally know two insanely qualified kids in the top 10 out of a class of ~700 who got rejected from their major (CS).

For you national merit kids, it also doesn‚Äôt mean much for UT. I can think of at least a dozen national merit finalists who were capped from my high school.

Also: the worst thing about UT once you‚Äôre there is how difficult it is to change majors, if you want to switch into cockrell, mccombs, or CS, best of luck to you.

One last word of advice: if applying for STEM, have relevant research and ECs. I personally find it absurd to expect 17 year olds to have their careers figured out but everyone I can think of who got accepted from outside of the top 6% had relevant research.


Moral of the story (TLDR):
UT Austin admissions are far too inconsistent for you to make UT your dream/match/safety. I was rejected, then accepted, then accepted to an honors program all from the same application (plus an appeal letter). Of all the schools, don‚Äôt let your self esteem balance in the hands of a UT admission counselor, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll do their best to destroy any trace of it.

I hope this was helpful, I‚Äôve learned a lot about UT admissions and college applications in general and I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions in the comments."

1580 SAT, 3.9/4.1 GPA

42k income for 7

Estimated contribution 5k a year from investments in my name (long story)

US citizen living internationally, so OOS for all schools basically

&#x200B;

Schools that worked (not the greatest financial situations, but still alright compared to \*cough cough\* santa clara university)  


Northeastern University: 8k/year

Occidental College: 8k/year

Reed College: 11k/year

University of Denver: 18k/year (still a slight oof)

Cal State Long Beach: 19k/year

I know these still aren't super great, but compared to some schools that were asking me to pay 50k/year plus, they're pretty good options! Anyways, just wanted to share a few schools to consider with you guys!"

But basically as the title says. I'm currently 23 but next year I would like to apply to go to college. I never did before because I had no clue what I would like to do, and a large family meant ZERO financial support for college. So anything money wise will have to be out of pocket, scholarships, and loans.

Back in high-school I had unchecked adhd. I failed a couple classes multiple times, not knowing that would affect my GPA. I also graduated on the "" minimum plan "" which basically cut a few credits so I could graduate "" earlier "" since I was a drop out risk. I didn't actually graduate earlier, but at 19 or 20.

None of my family went to college so they aren't any help with the process or advice. 

Will my bad performance in high-school affect my ability to get into school or what kind of financial assistance I'll get ? I know it's typically on a school by school bases, I've tried googling but I don't think I'm looking up the right things ?

Like most of the people in this sub, I spend most of my days thinking about college and stressing out about minor things. I didn't know when but slowly I began meeting people less and less. My life began to feel empty. 

I came across this post. It was a heartfelt story about a guy who got diagnosed with leukemia and had to drop out junior year. Reading his story, and how things changed for him in a small time just sank my heart. We never know what may happen to us. I realized that instead of worrying and nitpicking about every minute detail of my application, I can spend time with friends and family, which I will never get back. Life is more than just college and prep classes. It's not like I am going to completely forget about college but I will do other things too. I want to do some things which I will remember when I am old. Don't take it as my advice to just forget about college stuff and do what you want. I just wanted to type this to make myself realize that there are things outside that matter more to us."
57,"Why UK Grads Make Less, At Least for a Couple of Years",40,on0psa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/on0psa/why_uk_grads_make_less_at_least_for_a_couple_of/,6,1626675281.0,"You ever feel that the universe is compelling you to answer a question?

Three times in the past week, I've seen (here and elsewhere) questions raised about why UK graduates make less than grads in the US.  Shoot, I even had a student I work with this afternoon pose the same question.

There are a number of reasons, but the biggest reason that fresh out of undergrad salaries are so low in the UK is that many top companies hire through graduate schemes.

In the US, you strive to get an internship at the company you want to work at between junior and senior years, and then as long as you don't screw up, you get a job offer.  The internship is spent learning company culture and seeing if you're a good fit, but it's a lot to do in a few weeks.  Some companies spend a few weeks on this after summer hires arrive (looking at you, Big 4 Consulting companies), but thereafter, you're assigned a spot and get to work.  At many of these, it's up or out; while it's most pronounced at Investment Banks, there aren't a lot of 32 year old entry-level consultants at Deloitte.

The UK does things very differently through its graduate schemes.  It's not that internships don't exist (they do!), but many companies hire their new grads with a bit longer timeline in mind.  For anywhere between 18 and 24 months, new hires are either rotated through the company, learning a lot of different skills along the way, or given more in-depth training into their chosen field, letting them make mistakes in a safer environment.  In many ways, they are still learning, so the salary reflects that.  Once they've finished the graduate scheme, pay increases considerably.

The trade-off is that while you get a lot of experience, the pay isn't that great.  Sure, some fields (like consulting, banking, and tech) pay significantly more than the \~$45k that most placements offer.  However, you come out with a firm understanding of your company's culture and structure, which often leads to a full-time role afterwards.

This is even true in fields like law.  Solicitors finish their training, then are hired as junior solicitors.  They make a fraction of what lawyers in the US would make (which, btw, is over $200k for top firms in Big Law at this point), but they get two years to learn the ropes of legal practice instead of one.  Additionally, the stress level is considerably lower.  By the end of it, the salaries do match up.

The takeaway of this is that you should never consider your ‚Äúsafety school‚Äú merely a safety. Research all of the schools on your list, even if they don‚Äôt require a ‚ÄúWhy us?‚Äù essay. You might find some schools very interesting after research, or eliminate a school from your list because it looks boring.
