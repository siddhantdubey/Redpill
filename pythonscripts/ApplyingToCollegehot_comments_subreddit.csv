Think about all the amazing stuff about you and all the amazing stuff about them and then combine it. Find examples of clubs, research, professors, articles in school papers, classes, and any other specific reason why you want to attend their school and then use that to create a picture of you on campus.

Could you elaborate on the distinctions between ""Why us"" vs ""why major?""

Currently, I've been thinking of the why major as like a ""brief history of my experience and interest in this major"" type of thing. Should it be more of a ""why this major at THIS school"" essay? Like, ""I loved playing with legos, now I want to be a civil engineer, and College Z's unique curriculum in X and internship program for Y would allow me to follow my interests?

(Edit: just read your supp essay post, assuming the answer to the above question is yes)

In the why school essay, how do we show our interest in the school without falling into popular cliches, like ""wow has Yale residential colleges and a tight-knit community?"" On the flip side, how do we avoid overusing minute details like ""I want to take Professor J's seminar on the history of the fruit industry's regulations in the early 1920's""? 

In Yale's admissions podcast, they mentioned-- and I'm paraphrasing-- to avoid including tiny details information that came from some obscure Yale webpage in your why us essay. How else do we find concrete things to write about?",t3_okwmml

I think Yale is being a bit difficult there to say they don’t want kids to do research on their college who would potentially want to go there. So I wouldn’t do that for yale since they specifically asked you not to, but I think for other colleges it demonstrates to them that you’ve taken the time to explore their offerings and found classes that will meet what you’re looking for and excited about. 

But you can reach out to students and ask them questions about classes and projects. Potentially reach out to professors if that interests you. Read the school newspaper and talk about what you read that you’d like to explore",t3_okwmml

Also, the word ""helped"" is used in both news writing and advertising to carry a huge amount of weight when a stronger statement can't be made. For instance, ""helps to reduce cholesterol"" means ""we can't prove this reduces cholesterol, or else we would have said 'reduces cholesterol.'""

The claim would be stronger if the writer looked at the student's college application and saw notes that confirm the student's speculation. Because I think the writer *did* look at the application, with the student's permission, as a normal part of doing research, I'm not sure how much you want to credit the student's credit to the nonprofit.

Of course. And AOs take this into account.

Even if a school does not rank, they often provide some context of GPA distribution on the school profile. And if multiple applicants from the same school apply to the same college, you can be sure AOs are comparing GPAs.",t3_oncpnk
66,h5qxu54,t3_oncpnk,"Rank has always been used like this. It’s not a hard and fast “top 3% is better than top 5%,” it’s used in context with GPA to try to figure out grade inflation/deflation so the applicant at a deflated school isn’t at a disadvantage for having a 3.7 UW while being at the top of their class versus an applicant with a 4.0 UW at an inflated school in the middle of their class.",t3_oncpnk
67,h5r1jyp,t3_oncpnk,"Read this:  

http://uvaapplication.blogspot.com/2015/03/i-dont-care-about-your-gpa.html",t3_oncpnk
68,h5r8hs0,t3_oncpnk,"GPA and rank are not standardized. They don't provide the level of detail needed in a selective admission process. They are meaningless without context.

There are students with sky-high GPAs who have holes in their curriculum. One of my favs: an engineering applicant who hasn't take a core science in two years, but they have a high GPA because they racked up a ton of APs in other subjects.

A lot of schools gave up ranking (only 43% of my last incoming class came from a school that ranked...[we include that with the ""top 10%"" stat](https://ira.virginia.edu/university-stats-facts/undergraduate-admissions)) and some that do have quirky methodologies. There's a public school in my state that had 171 valedictorians last year. Their system works for them, but a student's rank doesn't tell me what I need to know.",t3_oncpnk
69,h5rcu5s,t3_oncpnk,The issue with rank is it makes a very competitive and toxic school environment in a school that’s already ultra competitive. My school (with a 80% Asian population) is ultra ultra competitive without rank as each person averages 8-10 APs and a 3.95 UW gpa where in each class you have to grind (no easy As even in honors). The school fucks over our mental health and if u add rank into that it’s going to just ruin the school. They had rank before but after 3 suicides they removed it. Sure it can make AOs life easier but can lead to a very difficult and toxic school culture,t3_oncpnk
70,h5r7egd,t3_oncpnk,"I think so since class rank shows how you can academically compete with a group of students and competitive colleges only want competitive students. I mean I have a 3.9 UW and am ranked 7/144 kids and always worry about how my gpa and class rank will be perceived by competitive colleges so I can relate to your anxiety. Also, I think that your gpa and course rigor/availability should always be analyzed together since the context of what was and is available to you is imo more useful than a ranking.",t3_oncpnk
71,h5rkduj,t3_oncpnk,"I disagree. If you’re at a school that doesn’t weight gpa, this would be a terrible idea. At my school, roughly 20% of my class is taking calc 3, linear algebra, differential equations, etc. Meanwhile, there is also a portion of my class which is taking stats. There’s nothing wrong with stats, but I think you have to acknowledge that calc 3 and such courses are substantially harder than stats. Consequently, a B student on the calc 3 route could very easily be an A/A+ student in stats. The same is true in science classes. You can take very rigorous classes like physics 2, physics c, etc. while someone else takes a class such as psychology. Again, you have to acknowledge a clear difference between the rigor of these classes. Someone enrolled in easier classes could have a 3.9, but i would argue having a 3.8 while taking harder classes would be much more impressive. So, to rank based solely on gpa and without consideration of the classes they have taken seems nonsensical to me.",t3_oncpnk

75,h5rakxt,t3_oncpnk,"My school doesn’t rank but they report the lowest and highest gpa of our class so if you have a 4.51 and the highest person has a 4.52, AO’s know you are in the tippy top section of grades",t3_oncpnk

The UVA blog post is utter B.S. Of all the top schools, UVA cares about GPA the most, at least if you believe actual data seen on Naviance graphs at different schools.

From that data, I know that UVA likes really high adjusted GPAs from out-of-state students, really, really high. Rarely do even the highest test scores make up for the lack of a nearly perfect GPA.

Admissions officers can talk about their intentions until they are blue in the face. Don't believe them. Look at the data.",t3_oncpnk

Also, most students at our high school avoid the Physics class (honors) because of the teacher.

I think there is also no reason for you not to apply to the scholarship program. If you could get into UChicago last year, you should still be able to get into good schools. Just make sure you have backup options, like US far safety colleges that have a good chance of giving you merit-based scholarships and your local institutions.",t3_ondqrq

166,h5rjr5t,t3_ongtdv,Look into any of the D1 schools in the U.S. All are excellent schools. I graduated from university of Illinois at Urbana-champaign a year ago and am starting med school through them in less than 3 weeks and I didn’t even have a phenomenal gpa in undergrad.,t3_ongtdv
167,h5ro5qr,t3_ongtdv,"I think liberal arts colleges, although the cost might seem high at points, are great. You can get a great letter of rec, and unlike bigger more research based universities, they won't ""weed"" you out in introductory science classes. You can build a strong relationship with your faculty.

Especially if they have a strong pre-med program. For example, one college I'm going to apply to is Mount Holyoke. Mount Holyoke(even though it's a hwc) has a wonderful [pre-med](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/prehealth) program which offers you advising from the moment you start to the moment you matriculate to a med school. Basically, just go for colleges with programs that will support you throughout your undergrad and make you the most prepared for med school.

But keep in mind you also want to go for places where you can get the best undergrad gpa. Don't go for places where there's a history of grade deflation.

And cost. I'm also considering my local state school system(the CSU's, not the UC's) because it doesn't really deflate grades as much and the cost is great as an in-state student. Especially SJSU and SDSU as their pre-med advising is pretty good. Depending on where you are maybe look and see what your in-state schools have to offer as a pre-med.",t3_ongtdv

Nobody cares what your college major is/was.  The only thing that matters is your GPA, MCAT, followed by your extracurriculars. A 4.0 from communication major is the same as a 4.0 for biology major - except the communication major probably had a hell of a lot easier time of it.   Anecdotally the communication majors are much more interesting to talk to versus the biology/biochem/neuroscience majors, which make up 95% of the applicants.

The internet was still *relatively* new to many people, so if you were looking for a place to discuss college admissions online, CC was pretty much the only game in town. The kind of banter was similar, except memes didn't exist yet, so you had stupid threads like ""guess the above poster's future college"".

Once social media really took off, there was a split, where the older generation that grew up prior to the internet found the message board format more familiar and so stuck with CC, and the newer generation (all of you) left for places like reddit. Now, CC is kind of a ghost town compared to what it once was, as the only posters who remained are the less tech savvy.

As to the ""D22"" or ""S"", this will happen when any term in a shared interest group becomes overused to the point that it's just easier to abbreviate it. Instead of ""daughter who will graduate in 2022"", you just say ""D22"" and everyone understands. You can see this on reddit as well on subs like r/amitheasshole or r/justnomil. r/maliciouscompliance had a reckoning with this a while back where posts became so confusing (e.g. ""D talked to S, and they accused me and W with assault"") that they had to add rule 8, which specified no acronyms for names.",t3_omwss7

231,h5qxo9b,t1_h5qryfs,As a parent on CC you would find the best place to ask questions are the parent forums which is separate from the general school forums. There are lots of parents from all over who have already gone through the process and navigated all the problems. Lots of good advice especially from the long time members. They will also readily help direct your question to a more fitting forum if needed. One good thing is since people are from all over they can suggest regional schools which might not have been on your radar.,t3_omwss7

I’m a so sorry about this year. Besides just being shitty because of COVID, I know family being sick is really hard. 

I would encourage you to step back. It’s only mid-July and taking some time for yourself won’t totally throw off your application timeline. Take a day and treat yourself.

Please just take care of yourself. I promise you that a college will definitely accept you. But really, you’re going to do great. Nobody else is going through your exact situation except you, so comparing yourself to other students wouldn’t be fair to you, either.

348,h5r6z51,t3_onees5,"for schools like stanford, you can say that you plan to major in pol sci and change it later! it will also significantly help your app, cs is more competitive than pol sci. make sure to research on how easy it is to change majors at the schools you're applying to.",t3_onees5

361,h5rfgut,t1_h5r9n5i,It depends on the college. Colleges that have one undergrad college or host CS under arts and sciences will usually be pretty generous with letting you switch majors (many of those only have you declare your major in your second year anyway). Those colleges usually don’t cap majors. Though I don’t know if it’s maybe harder getting into the classes/electives you want for CS since it has a lot of students majoring in it?,t3_onees5
362,h5rjx51,t1_h5r9n5i,Some colleges are super strict with it while others will make you fill out a form and you kinda need to show you wanna switch,t3_onees5

364,h5r8rsu,t1_h5r82r3,"Not necessarily, although I'm definitely aiming for T20. One of my safeties is Rutgers, which is #37 in cs according to us news, and with the added benefit of instate tuition I don't think I'll be applying to many other schools that would rank lower than that.",t3_onees5

370,h5rj4ko,t1_h5rhn40,"Online I read these two statements:

“Just remember that the admissions officers gets to see every section score from all the tests used to calculate your Superscore. Superscores look worse when your section scores are significantly different on one of your exams.”

“The superscore report will include the individual section scores from any test that makes up the superscore. Admissions officers can see the English, Math, Reading and Science score from any test administration, even if the superscore only takes one of those sections for its calculations.”

Are these statements false?",t3_onghui

In terms of what is available, not all colleges allow superscoring on ACT",t3_onghui
372,h5rkyc4,t1_h5rj4ko,"Yeah this is inaccurate. Colleges can’t see your scores unless you pay to send them from ACT or CB. ACT had the option to only send your superscore report, so they would only see that and the respective date the scores came from",t3_onghui
373,h5rl4v5,t1_h5rj4ko,"Yes and no, they're more misleading.

AOs *can* see every section of every score used to calculate your superscore, but they need to do a more in-depth search to actually see them. Even if they do see your other section scores, they'll only look at your best ones. (Unless the school doesn't accept superscoring at all)

And any ranked list of 20 or 50 is just picking favorites based on broad weighted sets of criteria that vary greatly in significance. 

Many universities have areas of excellence independent of the “average” of the rest of the departments. A T50 university I know well is widely considered to be best in the world in a specific area, and if you are in that field you definitely know that. Also every top university has areas of weakness, and others where they flat out suck. 

So why do we focus on T20? Because everyone’s grandmother and second cousin has heard of that set. You can use it to impress people at parties. Is it best for your career? Idk, maybe; they’re all really good schools after all. But maybe not. If you don’t look past USNWR you’re just taking a shot in the dark. I know plenty of HYPSM grads who didn’t turn out especially well. 

I have a HYPSM degree. Within my field, among the people who matter, nobody is the slightest bit impressed by that. Nobody. It becomes more impressive the further you get from my field. And holy mother of god was my mom determined to drop that information into perfectly irrelevant conversations.

One has to take three semesters of co-op to fulfill the co-op requirement, however it doesn't have to be continuous. The usual schedule I've seen is: 

* three single-block co-ops of 3-4 months each, or
* one double-block of 6 months and another single block of 3-4 months.

Depending on the major, the co-op requirements has to be fulfilled before the last school year. For example, Software Engineering majors have to finish the co-op before taking the senior project. As such, [the recommended schedule](https://www.rit.edu/computing/sites/rit.edu.computing/files/docs/VSEN%20Flowchart%20Version%209.1_2191%20curriculum_0.pdf) is one single block after sophomore year, and one double block after junior year.

703,h5ngafv,t1_h5ne432,"UW has this major system where majors are “capacity constrained”, while not all majors are like this, the ones that are capacity constrained tend to be the more popular and common ones- things that you can get a good job with (CS, Business, Engineering, etc.). Basically it means that not everyone is guaranteed a spot in their major because there are such limited spots, and because of this, those that don’t get into their major usually study their back up major, which in most cases is something they have no passion for, or just transfer out of the school entirely (you’d be surprised by the amount). Not to mention the class sizes are huge!!! In general, the major system at UW is insanely competitive and because of this, you’re having to constantly compete against your peers, which can contribute to the toxic environment. I’ve heard about many incidents that’ve occurred at UW, ranging from people making fake Quizlets just to sabotage their peers to people telling their peers a fake exam time just so they can beat the curve. UW is just not worth all of that. 

Some majors do direct admission, such as CS, Engineering, and Business, meaning you can apply to the major as a freshmen and have the chance to be accepted right away, meaning you don’t have to worry about applying to your major again. These majors tend to be the most competitive at UW and I even have friends who said that if they didn’t get into their major direct admission, they would NOT go to UW at all because the chances of getting into your major through regular admission are nearly impossible.

As for the surrounding environment, Seattle is not the most safest place. There are many crime reports, sketchy places, and even a few years ago a machete was found. There is also this thing called “Seattle freeze” which is basically seasonal depression due to the gloomy weather.

I would say that UNC Chapel Hill is more... theory based? in it's approach to STEM and thought, while NC State is more applied sciences working under the motto ""think and do"".

It'd be harder to get a job in the data science field compared to a CMDA major. However, it'd be easier to get a CS job compared to CMDA, which is the trade-off.  Also, in CMDA, you learn more Python/R than Java, which is something you gotta consider (you do learn some Java in CMDA but not to the extent of CS DCC). Finally, CMDA has a cool capstone course at the end which is basically an internship where you can work on a group data science project that a company gives you and some companies even hire some students at the end of the course. To my knowledge, I don't think any of the CS capstones (which includes CS DCC) have something like this.

If you're more interested in CS than data science but still want learn some things about data science, the CS DCC major would probably be the way to go. More interested in data science, go with CMDA.

Sorry, that's slightly incorrect. Employment before graduation is called CPT (Curricular Practical Training), while employment after graduation is called OPT (Optional Practical Training). CPT employment does not have a time limit, but one lost OPT eligibility if their CPT employment exceeds one year. Considering that STEM students can get up to three years of OPT employment (1 year + 2 years extension for STEM graduates), it's kind of a rule that one should not exceed the CPT limit.",t3_omroaa

Syracuse has about 15K undergrads across 10 colleges. I’m an admissions rep for our College of Engineering and Computer Science, and we also have outstanding Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Visual and Performing Arts. 

As a CS major, you could minor in the humanities or in music or art, etc. We’re a Research 1 (R1) university with many opportunities for undergrad research. 

Our CS majors land outstanding job opportunities in big tech companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.), finance (Bank of America, JPMorgan, Fidelity, MasterCard, M&T, etc.), consulting (Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, EY, etc.), and defense (BAE Systems, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, etc.) Those are just a few examples. The possibilities really are limitless for CS grads. As a CS major, you’ll be assigned to three advisors right away, including an Engineering and CS Career Advisor who will help with your resume, navigating the internship search and application process, preparing for Career Fairs, etc. 

We have a student-run hackathon every February. It’s called CuseHacks and it’s always of interest to CS majors.

We’re located in the City of Syracuse, NY, but we have a very green campus with a traditional Quad and a traditional college feel with lots of school spirit. (We call it the Orange family!) If you’d be flying, the Syracuse Airport is only 12-15 minutes from campus.

922,h5qb89s,t3_on77ji,It’s kind of a red flag tbh,t3_on77ji
923,h5quely,t3_on77ji,"is it a public state school? If you are a good student and it’s still a well regarded institution (R1 preferably), you should be fine in terms of being able to take advantage of the opportunities the institution offers while maintaining good grades but you definitely wouldn’t have the same experience as in a place where the graduation rate is like 85+%.

If it’s a private school and not R1 or some sort of nationally recognized university I’d be more concerned.

If the ACT range for example is like 21-28 and you are on the high end you should be fine in terms of graduating. A lot of times the whole “go to college” mentality pushes people who didn’t perform the best academically in high school to start off at 4 year institutions which can drag down graduation rates.

If there’s an honors program/college, I bet the graduation rates are much higher there. And by attending the honors college you’d be mixing with people from the higher end of ACT/GPA range so you’d still beable to network with people and you’d likely hang around with them more.

Since your in the major the school is well regarded for, you should probably be fine.",t3_on77ji
924,h5r6fi4,t3_on77ji,"Perhaps this doesn’t directly answer your question, but might provide some context. Graduation rates can indicate all sorts of different things. Of course, I’m sure the first thing that often comes to mind are institutional resources, support, and [engagement](https://twitter.com/gtadmission/status/1414644004197703682?s=21), which help students persist to graduation. 
But here’s what I find students don’t often think of:

Graduation rates can be a measure of selectivity. [You’ll notice ](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/highest-grad-rate) that most often, the schools with the highest graduation rates are schools with lower admit rates (or in other words, higher selectivity).

Graduation rates can be a measure of affluence and resources among their student community. Does the average student have barriers that make it more challenging to persist?  

Graduation rates and timelines will be impacted by the average students’ course load… and that can be impacted by rigor, affluence (again, is the average student at the school working?) or various other programs to apply education. For example-a 5 year coop program is pretty popular at Georgia Tech, as are internships and study abroad. That coupled with rigor of coursework, and other reasons you see here, means that our [grad rate ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPBR-L5FDHS/?utm_medium=copy_link) shoots up from 55% at the 4 year mark to 88% at the 5 year mark. 

The retention rate is not going to tell you the full story, given that often retention rates measure first to second year retention… if the school has a lot of transfers after the second year, for example, that wouldn’t be captured by the retention rate. Sometimes, these might be traditional transfers, but other times schools have specific transfer pathway programs set up. For example, Georgia Tech has a [transfer pathway program](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/repp) where students attend a partner school for two years, then transfer to Georgia Tech. That would impact the graduation rate at those institutions, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those students don’t go on to graduate.

All in all… in deciding [if it matters to you, ](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2021/07/16/the-top-1-question-to-ask-in-your-college-admission-experience/) I’d suggest coupling what you know about a school’s graduation rate with more digging on their community and programming to get a fuller picture of the circumstances.

935,h5q18oj,t3_on72dv,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the grade deflation thing? 

The worst classes (think BIOMG 1350, pre-med Cell Bio) have a median of a B, but a lot of the upper-div courses have A- medians so it's not too big of a hit on the GPA (still not as good as Harvard inflation though). For reference, I come from UCLA (which people also say deflates), and even then I don't think the averages were too bad there either.

But, to talk about Cornell pros:

* NYC? Lots of internship/recruiting opportunities (incl. on-campus recruiting), three/four hours by bus (which some people do for breaks or interviews), places to study (Weill Cornell Med lets you in, Cornell Tech is nearby) and lots of alumni (see: Cornell Club NYC).
* Really specialized majors? I know there are a lot of hidden, unique opportunities that you can internal transfer to (say, specializing beyond ""econ"" by doing labor economics in ILR, PAM in HumEc, SHA's econ courses, the applied econ minor, and so forth). 
* Unique courses? Ties with the above, but having a larger student body means funding for special classes, including a lot of unique concentrations or courses (the InfoSci department/major alone has courses in UI/UX, HCI, Robotics, and even Data Science and Game Design).
* Lots of people! I know having a larger student body can be a con, but it truly means you get to meet a lot of people coming with different perspectives. Before we split, my townhouse this year was to be composed of 4 people, each from different schools (CALS, SHA, HumEc, and CAS) and with 4 different majors (Bio, Stats, Fiber Science, and whatever Hotelies study). I think 15k is a happy balance between 2k (think Bowdoin, everyone knows everybody including the drama) and 35k (think UCLA/UCB, where it's kind of a massive horde and you find friends but will never know everyone).",t3_on72dv
936,h5q3kfd,t3_on72dv,"This is my reasoning…

Personally for location and weather, I don’t really mind. I prefer cold over hot anyway although I can see how winters can be harsh. In addition, I live in NYC the majority of my life so spending 4 years somewhere more secluded and surrounded by nature may be a once in a life time experience because I probably will be working in a city after college and perhaps stay there for the rest of my life. Regarding food, if you do the research, you will know that Cornell is highly ranked for dining. Moreover, grade deflation is quite apparent in a lot of other top ranked schools but I heard the College of Engineering is where they have it worst.

Pros:

* World-class programs in almost everything.
* Campus looks amazing in every season.
* Lots of clubs, sports teams, etc.
* Being in a smaller town means more things happen on/around campus.
* Smaller town has a nice, more relaxed atmosphere, lots of mom-and-pop shops and restaurants.
* Tons of internship opportunities, prestigious name, strong alumni network.
* Tradeoff of lacking big-city stuff to do means more opportunities for outdoors and athletic activities- hiking, skiing, skating, going to parks, sailing on the lake, etc.
* Lots of variety of students in terms of majors/hobbies/interests, lots of interesting people to meet.
* Many cities just a short trip away- easy to do weekend trips to cities like Boston, Philadelphia, DC, Buffalo, Toronto, Montreal, NYC if you want to do some city stuff. NYC, Syracuse, and Buffalo are close enough to do day trips, the other cities are about 5-6 hour drives.

In terms of your cons, some are fair while others aren't exactly true.

* The location may not be the best if you like activities only found in a city. However, Ithaca's traffic is nothing compared to a city's.
* Weather does get cold, but winter break covers the most severe part of it and there is fun stuff to do like skiing, skating, hockey, etc. Even at the worst times sunlight comes out each week, I have yet to see a long stretch of overcast with no sun.
* Your meal plan con is wrong, Cornell's dining is really good and consistently ranked as one of the best college dining in the nation.
* Grade deflation is largely a stereotype although we do not inflate as much as Harvard, Brown etc. and some classes especially in engineering to occasionally have low curves.
* Bigger student body, not sure how I myself will judge this in the end; on one hand, this means more friends, more clubs and opportunities to get involved, larger campus and more majors/programs; on the other hand, sometimes it is nice to have a smaller student body, potentially more tight alumni network and student body and (at least with wealthy schools) more resources to devote towards each student.",t3_on72dv

After sending in some of my transcripts and other grade reports, they guaranteed me a spot in Berkely if I were to maintain my current level of work.

in fact, i would go so far as to say that a lot of the phony NPOs actually harmed some people in college admissions. i’m obviously not an admissions officer, but I know a girl who did RSI, won a bunch of prestigious science awards, won olympiads, etc. and then at the end of junior year she started like 3 ‘NPOs’ related to girls in stem, teaching science to poor
kids (basically causes for which there are already NPOs). she was also rich and went to a top school (30% of the students go to t30s). she was rejected from every school except her safety (this was like a very talked about incident in my community lol).

This surprises me a little.  What were their intended majors?  Class rank?  NMF is top 1%, which is roughly the equivalent of a 1550.  This guy has a [scatter plot](https://texadmissions.com/blog/2019/2/25/recommended-ut-austin-majors-rank-and-test-score-minimums) of his clients' outcomes over the past five years for all majors.

There's one student right around the 6th percentile who didn't, then a bunch more who did until you get out to roughly the 12th percentile.  Granted, we don't know what those students' majors were.

Here's [another one](https://texadmissions.com/blog/2018/5/16/ut-austin-computer-science-acceptance-rate-and-application-tips) that's specifically for CS.  Of applicants with a 1510+ SAT who were in the top 6% of their class, only one out of fourteen did \*not\* get in.

Also -- you are telling people not to apply, you're telling them don't make it your dream/match/safety...meaning they wouldn't be on someone's list, so not sure why you're not trying to take that back. 

Personally, I had the experience of getting in, getting my major and then just hearing sweet nothing from them for awhile, but that was nearly a decade ago so take that with a grain of salt on your experience now or in future years, that definitely caused me to go elsewhere, but that won't have me telling people to not make it their dream school if they want to.",t3_omwkaj

As for national merit: Westwood had 78 semifinalists this year and I believe 75 finalists. TAMS had 75 semifinalists for the class of ‘20, not sure about the class of ‘21. Plano West seems to hover around the 70 mark as well but I know Westwood was the most in Texas this year.",t3_omwkaj

Med schools don’t really care about how highly rejective your undergraduate college is. For applying to med school, you want to graduate with as little debt as possible, have some research and/or hospital based experiences, make high grades, get strong letters of recommendation, and get a  high MCAT score. 

Be sure to check into the school’s med school acceptance rates. Ask whether they support all med applications or not. Some will just support their top students making their rates higher, so you need to be able to do comparisons about rates. 

Ask about opportunities to do research with professors and not just wash bottles. And think about and ask about ease of access for shadowing doctors. 

Look for colleges where students can build good relationships with their professors so that you can get strong letters of recommendation. Often, liberal arts colleges will work best for what you’re looking for if you can make them work financially for you. 

Notes about major from UT Houston McGovern Medical School:

“The study of medicine is based upon science, so the medical student must be a capable student of science. Therefore, majors in the scientific disciplines such as, but not limited to, chemistry, biology, and physics are satisfactory.

A liberal arts education is an excellent basis for a medical career. Accordingly, applicants may have majored in such areas as classics, languages, history, English literature, belles letters, music, or philosophy, provided the specific scientific requirements listed below are fulfilled. All applicants are expected to be well educated and able to demonstrate the intellectual interests associated with entry into a learned profession.”",t3_onf29t

1138,h5pkqtp,t3_on0psa,"Can you give your evidence for this claim? You're basically selling people on this idea that it's a temporary difference and not a permanent difference, but the stats I've seen don't support your claim. For example:

> It's not that internships don't exist (they do!), but many companies hire their new grads with a bit longer timeline in mind. For anywhere between 18 and 24 months, new hires are either rotated through the company, learning a lot of different skills along the way, or given more in-depth training into their chosen field, letting them make mistakes in a safer environment. In many ways, they are still learning, so the salary reflects that. Once they've finished the graduate scheme, pay increases considerably.

The US has an equivalent, they're called development programs but the main difference is they pay you handsomely as well. (See, FLDP for example.) I'm also not convinced by your claim and your link doesn't reflect this supposed ""low pay"" environment. It includes ""investment banking"" under this and the reality is that [investment banking salaries in London just don't ever catch up to American ones.](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banker-salary/) Outside of 50k pounds already being a top salary in the UK (so hardly ""low pay"" relative to the environment), reaching 160k base as a VP (in pounds) is much lower than the $300k base that VP's can get stateside. (At current exchange rates that's 220k and don't forget that taxes are likely higher in the UK too. So we start off with an 80k difference, and since bonuses are realistically based on base salary, that only expands.) Also, I'd love to see a 32 year old entry level consulting hire or investment banking hire at any of the top firms in the UK that doesn't also have a super unique background such as multiple tours of duty or something to justify it. 

Or:

> Additionally, the stress level is considerably lower. By the end of it, the salaries do match up.

So do the salaries match up or is the stress lower? Or do you mean to tell us that you believe that lawyers in the UK make on par with what American lawyers make but also have less stress? It's pretty well-understood that compensation in law in the UK will never match the US; you can work for Cravath in the UK vs. Cravath in the US and you will make considerably less. [See here](https://www.pro-recruitment.co.uk/blog/2019/07/uk-vs-us-law-firms-the-big-debate). [These trainee firms](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/job-sectors/law-sector/how-much-do-lawyers-earn) (if magic circle) can pay something like 50k pounds, which is again, a very high salary in the UK. Unsurprisingly, US firms pay the best as well even in the UK. The only reason someone wouldn't think so is if they have experience living in a place like America, where our comparable careers can command a much higher salary, or a place like Switzerland (for similar reasons.)

The simple reality is that people get paid less in the UK because it's poorer. These come with some benefits, some as a result of living in the country itself such as typically more generous healthcare packages (nationalised healthcare after all) and more time off, others such as cultural things. But I don't understand the need to cling to this fiction that everything is just better elsewhere. If you're looking to make the most amount of money, you're better off in the US.",t3_on0psa

1141,h5ps3nz,t1_h5pkqtp,"Few things here.

First, I understand not everyone is familiar with how law firm salaries work in the UK, with the idea of the trainee solicitor/graduate scheme.  As someone who is quite familiar, the step up goes (by year) 50k, 50k, then to 100k by year three.  Those who go on to be partners end up making well into the millions; you'll excuse me that I won't share my former professors' salaries, but one actively bemoaned making \*only\* 800k pounds a year compared to his friends in finance, who all mad at least double that.  

Of course, there are fewer hours worked (the idea of billing 2000+ hours per year is, frankly, laughable) in the UK, so there is something for quality of life.

Second, let's abandon this idea that somehow American college students are going to be swimming in money upon graduation.  [Nearly 1 in 5 thinks](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/many-college-grads-expect-to-earn-85000-in-their-first-job-this-year.html) they're going to make $85,000 or more at 22; outside of tech, I-banking, and consulting, that's not going to happen.  In reality, it's closer to [$51,000](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/average-starting-salary-for-recent-college-grads.aspx), though there are a number of different figures quoted; I merely went with one at the higher end.  

Third, as for proof that salaries do increase after the completion of a graduate scheme, that has actually been discussed on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/bvbedg/what\_sort\_of\_salary\_increase\_can\_be\_expected\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/bvbedg/what_sort_of_salary_increase_can_be_expected_at/)  For that matter, I never mentioned that you could make more in the UK; I was explaining why starting salaries were lower.  

Finally, it's worth mentioning that international experience does [tend to lead](https://studyabroad.ucmerced.edu/study-abroad-statistics/statistics-study-abroad) to higher salaries.  It's more pronounced when you work overseas, and [employers pay more](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/04/work-abroad-international-employees-see-salaries-rise-35percent-hsbc-expat.html) for cross-cultural talent.

1195,h5rxgzu,t3_onfm2u,"The terminology used will vary from school to school—and it's really really really important to note that **the name a school decides to use for their degree DOES NOT directly decide the value of that degree**. So if school A gives only a BA for CS, but school B offers a BS, that DOES NOT automatically mean you should pick B over A!

In general a BA is a liberal arts degree, so it will usually be given out by liberal arts colleges—that's just the traditional term used for their degrees. But plenty of LACs will offer excellent preparation for CS, so just because they only offer a BA doesn't mean employers will look down on your degree. Some big research universities will offer BA's as well, sometimes instead of BS degrees and sometimes in addition to them. If a school offers both a BA and a BS in CS, then usually the BS will require a few more courses than the BA (but not always!)—and again, nothing is stopping you from doing the work for a BS and getting a BA if you so choose, so the name of the degree isn't really what matters; what does matter are the courses you choose to take to get that degree and the level of preparation those courses give you.

Cornell costs a lot and doesn't give merit scholarships.  So, not ideal for you.

1386,h5r72hi,t3_onb6t9,"That's a question you should probably ask your counselor, as they'll know these deadlines better. At my school (in a different state), you have to turn in your form pretty early (April/May) to have priority for your class registration, and August would be the latest possible time to register. Yours might be different, but I would recommend asking your counselor ASAP to make sure you don't miss the deadline.",t3_onb6t9

1429,h5nqoqr,t3_omvntx,"But colleges don't compare weighted GPAs. They don't compare GPAs of students between different high schools at all. Some colleges recalculate on their own standardized scale (this is common among public universities) and others just look at the raw grades and coursework and evaluate academic performance based on that. The GPA value is not the thing that matters. The # of As, Bs, etc. relative to others at your high school - along with the rigor of your courses - are what matters.",t3_omvntx
1430,h5o243n,t3_omvntx,"Student A has a 4.0 UW GPA from taking all of the easiest courses at school.

Student B has a 3.85 UW GPA from taking only honors and AP courses at school.

In the eyes of college AOs, who is the better student?",t3_omvntx
1431,h5npkh0,t3_omvntx,"Yeah, I feel like there is a good deal of variation but very few go outside the range of about 4.0  max for a normal class, 4.5 max for an honors class, and 5.0 max for a dual/ap class. (maybe even honors getting grouped with ap/dual) Since most schools roughly follow this guideline basically having a weighted GPA over 4.0 on a 4.0 scale is great and that's all they really look for in that sense. For smaller disparities, they use class rank which just puts the numbers in perspective. For example, a 4.3 might be the top 20% at one school and be the GPA of the val at another. I am guessing this is just how they quantify it, rather than being saying oh 4.3 is automatically at this level or something.",t3_omvntx
1432,h5oatji,t3_omvntx,"When schools view your application, they also receive a school profile, which gives all the info of like GPA distribution, weighting system, average SAT scores, AP classes offered and pass rate, what schools students from the previous class got into, etc. Also, yeah many schools recalculate GPA using a standardized system (might look like not counting phys ed and only using the grade from one elective per year).",t3_omvntx
1433,h5q3fa8,t3_omvntx,"Idk if this is how all high schools work, but my high school uses weighted for class rank and UW along with course rigor for college stuff. When I sat down with a college counselor, he told me that colleges consider unweighted gpas *along* with your course list. So if you get a 4 by taking basic classes, that'll be an impressive gpa but not an impressive course list. On the other hand, if you have a 3.8 after taking 6 APs, that's gonna be a lot more impressive cause the admissions counselor can see you got a good GPA while taking hard classes.

Hope this helps!",t3_omvntx

1435,h5rmu88,t1_h5nqoqr,"^^ this is true but I just want to add that OP can still feel that it is unfair….Miami of Ohio just released their scholarship criteria and it’s based on weighted gpa from your transcript. They don’t recalculate it. So if you want that 34k a year you have to have a 4.3+ weighted gpa. If your school does 4.2 as the highest, sucks to suck.",t3_omvntx
