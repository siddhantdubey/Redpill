What you experienced is absolutely inappropriate and I would recommend writing a lengthy letter to Stanford admissions describing your experience.

If you want to take a strong, principled stand, state firmly in your letter that you are rescinding your application from Stanford and would appreciate a refund of the application fee due to this experience. 

If you do not decide to rescind your application, writing this letter well is likely to increase your admission chances, honestly. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a horrible experience :(.

edit: read some replies. I agree that the guy is just an asshole and probably not a racist. He's clearly the type that enjoys acting smarter than everyone in the room. For future interviews, though, do make sure that you can explain your research in great detail without notes. That is pretty important, for what it's worth. And although I personally disagree with the tactic, it's entirely possible that other interviews at your chosen schools will *feel* hostile and challenging.

So I went to MIT instead, majored in * gasp * something akin to neuroscience, and now I am an ICU doc.

Oh, and A BIG part of why I didn't return to Boston to do my ICU fellowship at Boston Children's (the Harvard children's hospital) was my memory of my interview for undergrad.

My advice: There are bad eggs associated with every otherwise reputable school. If it helps you, use the experience as fuel to show those types up.

Sorry you had a bad experience in this, like others have said you should definitely submit a report (but remain professional/respectful in it).

SOMETHING TO MENTION IN YOUR REPORT. In the fall 2017, the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) new policy made it unethical to ask prospective students their schools or university preferences.

Admissions boards take this kind of thing extremely seriously.

The sad truth is that interviewer training for many colleges is very poor, and certainly behind the times. In most locales, interviewers are largely not a very diverse group of people, and their views of what a good candidate is are based on what they experienced in college.

Nobody should ever need to go through open discrimination, no matter their race, and especially NOT IN A COLLEGE INTERVIEW.

Almost all of the comments your interviewer gave you, mine gave me, and we share a similar academic background. I'm not Asian exactly (middle eastern background, which doesn't count as Asian in the USA).

The difference between what you described and my interview was all about tone. I thought my interviewer was trying to get me to look deeper, and he wanted to approve me, but he really wanted to know why I was exceptional. He didn't badger me or belittle me or harass me. When I gave an example of my work that wasn't good enough, he just asked for another example that had more of whatever he was looking for. He definitely had concerns and definitely wasn't sure if I was good enough, even with my extensive academic background. But he was honest and polite the entire time.

So for all the people who are saying the interviewer was trying to achieve something with the way he talked to you, I can say from personal experience that I've been in THAT interview, and it doesn't sound anything like what you went through.

What you just experienced was exceedingly unprofessional and exceptionally uncharacteristic of the interview process for any university that provides interviews.

Please report this immediately.  If there are enough reports that go through showing that this person is exceptionally unqualified to be interviewing students it is very possible the school will ignore a number of the interviews the interviewer has performed (if not all) and offer another interview with a college admissions officer or another interviewer (depending on when this person's behavior has been recognized and whether or not there are interviewers available in your local area that are not booked).

Unfortunately I can't really help you directly because I do not carry connections to Stanford's admissions office but again I must emphasize. Report this individual immediately. The closer to the date of this interview the better.  Make sure the report is as clear as possible.  Try to quote the individual verbatim as much as possible.

For full disclosure, I am an alumni interviewer of one of the other schools you're applying to and made this throwaway to respond.

Typically, I would side with the interviewer in these cases, but when I was in your shoes many years ago, I felt like I faced a similar situation with an interviewer at a college I ended up not going to. I would say that if the interview went as you described, it is very abnormal and not representative at all of what Stanford has to offer. Now that I'm on the other side, I can recommend you some steps. Here's what I would do if I were you:

Stanford most likely uses their alumni network to do applicant interviews and there's a chair for the region where you interviewed. I would recommend you find someone who is a Stanford alum in your area, explain your situation and try to get the email address of the Alumni Interview Chair of your region. You should email the Chair, explain your situation as politely as possible, and ask if it's possible to arrange another interview with another alumni. 

Unfortunately, I think your chances of getting into Stanford will most likely be significantly diminished by this (if the interviewer gives you a low mark and you don't get another interview, your odds of getting in will drop dramatically), but it's certainly worth a shot and you may hit it off with another interviewer if given a chance. 

Cheers, and best of luck.

(it seemed to me that people who get into Stanford, at least now, have already made something of themselves and would be successful without Stanford. I love the university I go to now and find it perfect for my personality and efforts)

but the way my interviewer talked about his life after graduation really instilled a sense of respect in him from me. He shared a story of how he struggled and “fell off the horse” so to speak. The only reason he got back into the job market was because some recruiter saw Stanford on his resume and figured he was pretty smart. He was incredibly humble and made a point to describe the motivation and effort of the most successful people he attended undergrad with. He was incredibly relatable and human- completely opposite of how your interviewer seems. I’m sure my interviewer noticed some shortfalls in my explanations of why I wanted to go to Stanford, but he had the insight to understand why I thought it was worth a shot anyway and why I might not know exactly what I want to do with my life as a 17 year old. Much less how I’m going to “change the world.” 

You seem like an incredibly strong person for withstanding this seemingly strong intellectual- who is the definition of a weak man. Your interviewer is weak because he fails to leave positive marks where he treads. Only the strongest people leave places better than when they came. I am certain you will grow from this experience and thrive in whichever path you choose to take next year. The fact that you even had research to defend means that you are making good progress in your scientific career. It was his loss that he did not realize you can grow from any of the shortfalls he perceived you had made. 

Go forth with motivation from this experience- that you can become both a well educated and successful person who maintains humility and graciousness towards all you meet. I wish this for both you and I. I’m very excited for the progress I’m sure you will make in whatever project you pursue.

I started off by thinking this whole thing was a test (e.g. is the student one that would stand for someone making inappropriate commets?). But I would guess they professors demor would have changed quite quickly if that were the case.

You did a fine job and sound like you are a good candidate. That professor probably has some self esteem issues and you were an outlet. The university should hear about this as there were and will be other victims. If the interviewer is in your department, I'd withdraw the application. If they are not, I would consider requesting someone else. You sound driven. What you learn is a vector quantity. You define how far you go and the university defines your direction. You dont want to choose a professor/department that will make you miserable because you will likely push your issues on to others. Just as with interviewing for a job, this interview was to see if you are a good fit for them AND if they are a good fit for you. Edit:(It sounds like Stanford replied to you and is interested in addressing this issue. I suggest following through with that because Stanford is the top university in my mind for academics. Keep in mind though that you can achieve 90% of any education at any top university and your mental state after is also very important).

I also agree with others that this may not be a race thing but we were not there. My opinion is that there is almost no racism at any high level university because there is a massive mix of professors of all nationalities and everyone earned their their position. I think that anyone working as a professor in these areas can't help but lose racist views they may have had prior. 

Other people here stated that you should have your research memorized. I did a masters in statistics and there is no way I could memorize all of the formulas I used. What I did in interviews is bring supportive documents. This does a few things; it allows you to show them, in a more consumable manner, how you approached different things and it allows you to save face when you do not have things memorized (you can  say ""on page 7 you can see how I used x to do y which resulted in z"" and then slide them the document with important parts highlighted).

Just for future reference, one thing I do at the end of interviews is I note what I struggled with and ask the interviewer if they mind if I get back to them on a few things. I'd spend the night researching every question and email them with 2 sections: answers and explanation (separated in case they want a quick read or want to be shown the depth of what I learned). This will show that you have the passion to find answers to problems enxountered.",t3_9vw5qw

When I was in HS one of my teachers friends did college admissions and came in to do mock interviews with us. On the first one he was great and pleasant and engaging.

Why should I even continue this interview?"". He told us afterwards that some interviewers will act like that if they want to see how you react to negativity and if you can keep a cool head and still present yourself well. 
Its obviously possible this wasn't what your interviewer was doing. And even if it was I have no idea what to recommend as far as the correct steps on how to handle it. Maybe they want you to end the interview to show you won't let yourself be bullied. Maybe they want you to stick it out because the real world has crappy people you have to deal with. Maybe they want you to report him to the school to show you are a good citizen and can recognize it was not proper conduct. Maybe there is no best response and you just need to do what's right for you.

132,e9gq99v,t3_9vw5qw,"I've been a volunteer college interviewer for Yale for many years. I imagine that Stanford conducts interviews generally the same way. I strongly agree with other comments here encouraging you to contact Stanford/the admissions office directly with what happened, but will add that, for what it may be worth, the value of this interviewer's opinion to Stanford is probably quite low, if not entirely irrelevant. I would expect that this interviewer probably deals with all applicants in a similar way, and probably writes long, rambling, incoherent reports on applicants that the Stanford admissions office likely ignores (because of how useless they are). I think it's quite rare for interviews to actually ""hurt"" applicants, and I can imagine admissions officers at Stanford rolling their eyes whenever they see a report from this guy on students. College admissions officers know interviewers (not necessarily personally), and, at least in my opinion and experience, find certain interviewers more or less useful based on prior experiences/reports on applicants... this guy is almost undoubtedly in the ""useless"" category. At the same time, there's probably little or no incentive (at least prior to your interaction with home hopefully being reported to the admissions officers!) to remove him as an interviewer, since there are usually more applicants than people willing to interview them.

I've had students who I've written glowing recommendations for that were extremely academically qualified that did not get into Yale, and had students that I was not particularly impressed with get accepted (and matriculate). So, even presuming that I am a ""good"" or ""valuable"" interviewer, my opinion doesn't really count all that much.

(I am also fairly shocked this interview went on for 2 hours: if I, for some reason, didn't like an applicant, I would simply cut the interview short, and I can't ever recall an interview going beyond an hour and a half, even for students that I really, really liked.)

147,e9gignn,t3_9vw5qw,"It’s fairly obvious he was testing how you would respond to failure. (It should be obvious because of how he responded to when you mentioned Harvard). He puts you under pressure, and tells you that everything you’ve ever done is worthless to see how you react. Do you lack self-confidence and become flustered? Do you lose your temper? Or do you stand by your achievements? 

Your logic for coming to the conclusion that he was racially-biased is flawed, as well. Stanford has a large overrepresentation of Asians, and your only “evidence” for believing he was biased was that he was talking about your studying? In a school admissions interview? 

Anyways, clearly you failed if this is how you respond. As someone with experience performing this kind of interview (not school admissions, but same methodology), my advice to you is don’t ever believe you deserve anything. Your history doesn’t matter, what you’ve done, what you’ve worked for doesn’t matter. Just because you have experience doesn’t mean someone else doesn’t have even more potential.

What is “my IB”? What does it mean to be “predicted an A”? You get a grade before a grade? Several times you mention terms with no context and expect your audience to know what that is - is it possible you were doing the same with the interviewer? He was an electrical engineer and you debated him on the financial policies of the fed. You told him you don’t drink and then that you do.

The first flag was the immediate “didn’t catch that” comment. Even the biggest assholes don’t usually start off with something like that. That’s just not normal behavior for any type of interview regardless of whether the person is a dick or not. Unless, however, there was a reason for it.

You might have done excellent in the interview. But the point that he clearly undermined everything you said and made harsh accusations seems like a flag. Some interviewers in the real world (I say that because you’re 18, no offense) like to see how the candidate will handle difficult situations and difficult people. Instead of just answering simple predetermined questions in a monotonous way, you can much easily gauge someone’s personality by how they react to a situation. In this case, that situation would clearly be a shitbag as an interviewer. That might be his way of interviewing to see how students react. Stanford Im sure is a very tough school (which I know nothing about) with a very stress-heavy academic calendar. Students who break over someone who is just an asshole to them might not make the cut. They might be looking for people with a thicker skin. 

I think it was great that you held your own and didn’t break character and unleash on this guy. Even if I’m entirely wrong and he is just a shitbag, you still took the high road and didn’t drop to his level. If I’m right, you looked fantastic in the interview.

Later into the conversation, he casually mentioned that there were Eastern European people who he was classmates with and called them “euro trash” -being of color myself, I was very taken aback and didn’t know what to say, and I just awkwardly nodded along and silently wondered what he must think of me if he was willing to say these things in front of a senior in high school that he had just met.

I am a Stanford grad and can confirm that (as with any blue chip university), there are going to be some hyper-competitive a-holes and hyper-inflated egos affiliated with the school.  There is some actual merit to some of the more general comments made by this jerk—not the ones personally attacking you, but the ones about the culture of the school, the comparative academic reps of some of your other choices, etc—but my experience was that there was definitely plenty of room for many wildly different types of people at Stanford, not just this d-bag’s version of what a Stanford person looks/sounds like.  Seems like he was possibly testing (inappropriately, in my view) how “tough” you are—how you will be able to withstand criticism, being challenged, etc.  I would not pull my application per the advice of some on here—you could still get in—and as I said, this guy does not represent all of us.  

I would consider filing a complaint, however (without speculating on racial motivations—unless he said something specific, that would come across as pretty recklessly speculative.  You may indeed be right, but nothing you described of your conversation is solid evidence of that).  There is enough about the way you were treated to be upsetting to me as an alum without getting into specifics of motivation.  Others in admissions will likely feel the same way—it reflects poorly on the school and it is important to prevent this kind of toxic b.s. from becoming an accepted part of the admissions process.  

Good luck in the rest of your journey.  Hope you get in to one of the schools of your choice.

u/breadwinner235 not being able to describe your research properly is an awful, awful, *awful* mistake. When I interview people who claim some kind of knowledge or experience in research, I question them at length on it precisely because a fair number of students will skate by on others' work and overstate their contribution. Questioning is how I figure out if the student has actually put the effort in or if they're pretending. When you can't coherently describe your work, you're put in the ""pretender"" camp and it weighs very heavily on you, effectively removing your experience from the list of things that you have achieved. 

I've also been in interviews where the interviewers' primary jobs were to be aggressive and to make me doubt myself, even going so far as to pretend to be offended at things I'd said.

Their job isn't to systematically break down and demean your entire character in some weird perverted test, and if that's seriously what you think high schoolers should be subjected to just to get into schools then you're not only kinda messed up but also completely wrong, because schools don't do this. I know many people that have gone through this process in elite schools, or that work in this sector and all of them would tell you this.

I wonder if the same trusted admissions rep was the one that thought Brock Turner was the ideal graduate for Stanford.   

This is not anything against Stanford  University, but an employee that has no tact or lacks the emotional professional experience.    The world is full of people that should not be in public positions because they do not have the emotional intelligence regardless  of them being subject matter experts.  This has nothing to do with competition, but in a way it is a pompous misuse of power.  It is unfortunate it happens, but it does.

There are many successful and brilliant professionals that will talk about their  humbling beginnings  in an admissions office, of their choice,  and how it was a blow to their ego.  But in introspection they are glad it happened because it led them to other better opportunities to sucess.    If I were OP I would not waste my time on this matter, but focus on targeting other universities and continue to grow.   In time their maturity will mentor other on how not to behave.

On the other hand, I don't think he necessarily represents Stanford. In my school at least, there is no selection to be an interviewer, only a brief training, and you interview whoever is geographically located close to you. The admissions committee never interviewed me or anything, but I can't imagine they would keep him on if he got reported as being racist and dismissive.

One of the things I hated about going from high school into the work and college world, is that success was really less about my skills and a lot more about my ability to please others. 

Some people like the interviewer use trick questions and “tests” to try and get you to “read their minds” and “prove yourself.” Sometimes all it is, is phrasing it the way they want to hear. Marketing. I don’t really like this stuff, but it’s sort of a necessary evil.

528,e9gzjqg,t1_e9gywir,"I earned a PhD in (at the time) the number one program in the nation (possibly world). I have worked in Centers of Excellence and at NIH. I have been addressed disrespectfully by academics only twice—both by Ivy Leaguers who dismissed me at the time because I look younger than my age 40 at the time). The only people I’ve ever heard speak in such a narcissistic manner were all Ivy Leaguers. 

This type of behavior is absolutely NOT tolerated anywhere I’ve been in academia. In fact, this kind of behavior would have resulted in a formal complaint and possibly in firing. It demonstrates extremely poor judgment and abuse of power. 

Hostile intimidation of interviewees is completely unnecessary and unprofessional. Grill them hard on their research as much as you want, but ask them questions that allow them to put their best selves forward. These are supposed to be people who have huge potential, but they are still becoming, not completely finished. There are more effective techniques than puerile power moves and wildly inappropriate comments in an entrance interview.",t3_9vw5qw
529,e9hd1r9,t1_e9gsw70,"Well, that may be the case. If so, one of my greatest hopes is that along the way, they will also discover a passion for learning and a sense of shared purpose with some of their professors.  I don’t mean indoctrinating them into the cult of “do-nothing” academe (although that will happen to some of them!  We will suck some of the brightest into the PhD career track!) but the discovery that some area of study is just so  truly fascinating that it will be a thing they stay curious about their whole lives.  I used to help administer a big survey of undergrads, and when we asked them about their most meaningful experiences on campus, the answers make it clear that this does happen for some students.  

On the bright side:  since I’ve outed myself as a person without the chops to have a real job, this may cut down on applicant requests to read their essays.  Maybe I should change my flair?",t3_9vw5qw

I would venture to guess that he gives good interviews to the attractive girls and bad interviews to the unattractive ones. ",t3_9vw5qw

538,e9i6hnv,t1_e9h3epo,"In all seriousness, I knew someone in admissions.  She talked about some of the insanity of the industry - getting thousand of applications, for example, of male varsity tennis players with 4.0+ GPAs who were president of the student council and had near-perfect SAT scores.  I mean, thousands of applications from essentially the same person, over and over and over.

Some institutions would take piles of applicants like this, throw them in the air, and accept the first application that hit the floor.  No joke.  

So yeah, to them, everyone they see has high grades/SAT scores, whatever.  When there was actually someone interesting (by comparison) - someone who has worked at a premier research institution and published in a prominent journal, gotten a patent on some medical advancement, published to a respected literary journal, started a successful business, mobilized a humanitarian or political movement, - those are the people the big leagues want.  Grades, GPAs, extracurriculars are the prerequisite; they want the person who has already shown that they have done something even adults would struggle to do.

There really are some truly amazing high school students out there who have achieved things you wouldn’t believe.",t3_9vw5qw
539,e9poozp,t1_e9ow0ew,"Sure.

He had sex with his Thiel fellows. The selection board had to remove him from the selection process.

He (although he supposedly regrets it now) has published writings openly questioning the legitimacy of rape, the ability of women to vote, and supported Apartheid.
